      "  - Participation in the 2030 Core Group: The bank is engaged with this group, signaling a commitment to long-term, ambitious sustainability goals.\n",
      "  - Integration into core operations: Sustainability considerations are embedded into the bank’s day-to-day operations rather than treated as a separate or additive program.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ambition and messaging\n",
      "  - Purpose-driven stance: The bank emphasizes not only meeting targets but leading by example, inspiring others, and contributing to a more sustainable and resilient world for future generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Climate action and energy efficiency\n",
      "  - Energy-saving measures across facilities: A comprehensive suite of energy-saving initiatives has been implemented beyond solar power.\n",
      "  - LED lighting rollout: All branches and offices are equipped with LED lighting to reduce energy consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The focus areas (as described in the material)\n",
      "  - Reducing carbon: A stated area of focus is to reduce carbon emissions, aligning with broader climate action objectives (as part of the PRB framework). Note: the excerpt ends with “reducing carbon,” so this is one of the key focus areas highlighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notes and caveats\n",
      "- The retrieved excerpts emphasize governance (PRB alignment and 2030 Core Group), the approach of leading by example, and concrete energy-efficiency actions (LEDs and energy-saving measures). They also indicate a focus on reducing carbon emissions, though the exact scope and metrics aren’t fully detailed in the snippets provided.\n",
      "- If you’d like, I can fetch additional documents to provide more detail on metrics, specific targets, governance structure, and any sustainability-linked financing initiatives.\n",

      "\n",
      "- History and symbolism\n",
      "  - White coats became associated with physicians in the late 19th/early 20th century as medicine modernized. White conveyed cleanliness, science, and professionalism.\n",
      "- Practical reasons\n",
      "  - A protective barrier: helps protect doctors’ clothes and can be laundered at high temperatures.\n",
      "  - Easy to clean and inspect: white shows stains or contaminants clearly, signaling when a coat needs cleaning.\n",
      "  - Functionality: coats have pockets for pens, light sources, tools, etc.\n",
      "- Patient perception\n",
      "  - The coat can convey authority and trust to patients. There’s also something called “white coat syndrome,” where some patients feel increased anxiety around clinicians in white coats.\n",
      "- Variations today\n",
      "  - In many settings, doctors also wear scrubs (especially in operating rooms) or color-coded coats to distinguish roles.\n",
      "  - Some infection-control guidelines encourage shorter sleeves or “bare below the elbows,” and practices vary by country and hospital.\n",

      "  - S2 (Climate-Related Disclosures): Focuses specifically on climate-related risks and opportunities and is aligned with the TCFD framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Level of prescriptiveness\n",
      "  - S1: Provides the general framework and materiality guidance; it tells you what needs to be disclosed at a high level but leaves many specifics to what is material for the entity.\n",
      "  - S2: More prescriptive for climate topics, detailing required disclosures and metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Required disclosures\n",
      "  - S1: Requires disclosure of material sustainability-related financial information, including governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics/targets for the topics that are material.\n",
      "  - S2: Requires climate-specific disclosures in four areas: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics/targets. It also requires climate-related scenario analysis (where applicable) and climate-related metrics (e.g., GHG emissions by scope, energy use, and related indicators).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Metrics and reporting\n",
      "  - S1: Lets entities decide which sustainability metrics are material and report them accordingly.\n",
      "  - S2: Specifies climate-related metrics (e.g., Scope 1, 2, and often Scope 3 GHG emissions, energy consumption, energy intensity, etc.) and climate-related targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Alignment with other frameworks\n",
      "  - S1: Provides the umbrella framework for sustainability disclosures.\n",
      "  - S2: Explicitly aligned with the TCFD recommendations for climate disclosures.\n",
      "\n",
      "- How they work together\n",

    "Domain Choice and Rationale\n",
    "I chose sustainability and corporate governance reporting as the domain for this agentic RAG system because it aligns directly with my current role as a sustainability intern. In practice, I regularly interact with frameworks such as IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, GRI Standards, and ESG-related corporate disclosures. These materials are often lengthy, technical, and scattered across reports, which makes them a strong candidate for a retrieval-augmented system. Building the agent around this domain allowed me to test how well it could support real-world sustainability work, such as summarising company strategies or clarifying reporting standards, rather than relying on abstract or purely academic examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Chunk Size Tuning\n",
    "Chunk size was tuned through a balance of practicality and experimentation. Sustainability and governance documents often contain closely related ideas across governance, strategy, and metrics, so overly small chunks risked breaking context, while very large chunks reduced retrieval accuracy. The final setup produced just over 6,000 chunks, which proved to be a good middle ground. This size allowed the agent to retrieve coherent sections—such as governance structures or sustainability strategies—without pulling in excessive, unrelated content. The results suggest that the chosen chunk size preserved meaning while still enabling precise similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Decision Quality\n",
    "The agent generally made good retrieval decisions. In the tests, conversational or general knowledge questions such as “What’s up?”, “What is Python?”, and “What is 2 + 2?” were answered directly without retrieval, which is the desired behaviour. Questions that clearly required document grounding—such as “What did MTN report as their governance structure?” and “Give me a comprehensive summary of Access Bank’s sustainability strategy”—correctly triggered retrieval. This shows that the routing logic is largely effective. However, a few general knowledge questions (for example, “Why do doctors wear white?”) were routed to retrieval when a direct answer would have been sufficient, indicating room for refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What Worked Well and What Needs Improvement\n",
    "What worked particularly well was the agent’s ability to summarise sustainability-related content in a structured and readable way once relevant documents were retrieved. This is especially useful in a sustainability context, where clarity and accuracy matter. The main area for improvement is retrieval selectivity. Introducing a stronger distinction between general knowledge and document-dependent questions would reduce unnecessary retrieval calls and improve efficiency. Overall, the system performed well for sustainability-focused use cases and shows clear potential as a practical support tool for sustainability and ESG analysis."
